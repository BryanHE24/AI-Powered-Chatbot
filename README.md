# AI-Powered ChatBot Web Application

## Overview

This is a web-based chatbot application powered by Google's Gemini AI. It allows users to interact with the chatbot, save chat sessions, and view chat history. Users can also delete past chats from the sidebar and create new chat sessions.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: Used for building the interactive web interface.
- **SQLite**: Database to store chat sessions and history.
- **Python**: Main programming language for backend logic.
- **Google Gemini**: AI language model for generating responses.
- **UUID**: To generate unique session IDs.

## Features

- **Chat Interface**: Interact with the chatbot through a clean and user-friendly interface.
- **Chat History**: Save past chat sessions and view them from the sidebar.
- **Session Management**: Create new sessions and delete previous ones.
- **Responsive**: Works well across devices with an intuitive UI.

## How It Was Created

This project was built to allow users to have conversations with a chatbot powered by Google‚Äôs Gemini model. The app stores chat histories in a local SQLite database and provides a simple interface built with Streamlit. Each session is uniquely identified by a session ID and the first user message serves as the session title. Users can view past conversations, start new chats, and delete old sessions from the sidebar.

### Project Structure

- `app.py`: Main file where the Streamlit app runs, handles session management, and displays chat history.
- `chatbot.py`: Contains functions for interacting with Google Gemini and generating chatbot responses.
- `db.py`: Handles the SQLite database operations, such as saving and retrieving chat history and managing chat sessions.
